This repository is a sandbox for the final project of Computational Literacy course (LDA-H305) given by [Eetu Mäkelä](https://jiemakel.gitbook.io/cl4hss) in 2022 (autumn term, period 2). 

1.What are your humanities/social science research questions? How do they relate to possible prior and related work?
The research question is **How Chinese electronic newspapers present climate change issues?** (with comparision of mainland-based Global Times and HongKong-based Southern China Morning Post). 
This is an investigation on digital environmentalism in Asia, with aims of implementing text analysis tools/methods to explore discourses of climate change in electronic news. More specifically, I aim to identify common themes and frames of climate change using a novel sample, with inspirations from Hase et al. (2021), Climate change in news media across the globe: An automated analysis of issue attention and themes in climate change coverage in 10 countries (2006–2018) and Broadbent et al. (2016), Conflicting climate change frames in a global field of media discourse. The analysis sheds light on nuanced differences between climate change discourses in Mainland (GT) and Hong Kong (SCMP), which has been overlooked by existing cross-country studies of climate change journalism.

2.Which data did you use?
Online news articles of 2 outlets with the keyword “climate change” from 1/1/15-31/12/17 obtained from Fisher, Scott, 2022, "China's Global Times Articles from 9 Apr 2009 to 31 Dec 2020", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/0J6P8T, Harvard Dataverse, V1 and Nexis Uni (engine search for SCMP articles).

3.What did you do to the data, and how can I reproduce it?
TBA

4.What does the analysis show, how does it answer the humanities/social science research question? How do the results relate to possible prior and related work?
TBA

5.Critically analyse your data and pipeline for potential bias and problems. What would still need to be done for the analysis to be trustable?
- Unable to open and distribute the dataset​ due to license restrictions
- Data representativeness is unguaranteed as I do not own access to the complete archive for data collection
- Distant reading can be restricted to understand the material compared to close reading
- Reliance on pre-built computational without substantial fine-tuning can lead to bias
